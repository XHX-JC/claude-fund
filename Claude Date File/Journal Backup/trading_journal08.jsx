    "summary": "REVISED SESSION 08: Trump announced US withdrawal from Iran in 2-3 weeks, claiming regime change achieved. Iran FM Araqchi says trust is zero, no negotiations taking place, demands reparations and Hormuz sovereignty. Base case: Trump declares victory and leaves. Iran does not challenge this publicly but insists no active negotiations occurred. Hormuz transitions from closed to Iranian toll regime (Suez-type charges under pretext of war reparations). War premium deflates 10-20% on oil. Supply chain premium persists — fertiliser planting damage already done, helium disruption ongoing but likely to ease under toll regime, EU energy independence policy pivot is STRUCTURAL and permanent. European defence thesis intact as Trump NATO fallout continues. Nuclear buildout accelerated by third energy crisis in 4 years. Key sectors to benefit: EU defence, nuclear supply chain, green hydrogen/electrolysis, fertiliser (N. American producers). Key sectors at risk: airlines, cruise lines, Asian semiconductors (short-term helium), EM equities.",

      "note": "SESSION 08 — 1 APR 2026. THESIS REVISED: 'Trump exits Iran — Hormuz toll regime — supply chain premium replaces war premium.' Trump announced US withdrawal in 2-3 weeks from Oval Office, claiming regime change. Iran FM Araqchi says trust is zero, no negotiations, demands reparations + Hormuz sovereignty. Base case: Trump declares victory, leaves. Iran keeps Hormuz under toll control. War premium deflates, supply chain premium persists. IBKR CROSS-CHECK: Started with 15 positions. Net Liq $96K→$97.3K. Unrealized improved from -$3,466 to -$822. 10 of 16 positions now green — strongest recovery since fund inception. KEY TRADES: (1) IAG.L 2200 shares SOLD — limit 365p FILLED AT 370p. Profit ~£326. Peace dividend thesis correctly identified as broken under toll regime. Tactical exit bracket worked perfectly within hours. (2) ITM Power 3100 shares BOUGHT @ 64.8-65p. EU hydrogen/energy independence play. 8-month pre-breakout base. Record revenue, £152M backlog, £197.8M cash. Stop 55p GTC placed (recommend lowering to 50p). PORTFOLIO NOW: 15 positions. Cash improved — GBP debit reduced from -£9,604 to -£3,486 on IAG exit. NEW WATCHLISTS CREATED: (A) Supply chain disruption: CF $115-120 entry on pullback, NTR $70-73 on pullback, LIN watch only. VLO removed (above target). (B) EU Energy Basket: CWR.L (250-270p entry), ITM.L (ENTERED), AFC.L (moonshot), Enapter H2O.DE (research), Ilika IKA.L (moonshot), Alfen ALFEN.AS (research), Yellow Cake YCA.L (500-520p pullback), Costain COST.L (research), Assystem ASY.PA (research — strongest under-radar name). DEEP ANALYSIS COMPLETED: CWR fundamental deep dive — revenue flat £22M, losses widening to -£54M, debt free, £147.8M cash, 27x sales = expensive. Already surged 339%. Momentum trap at current levels. ITM preferred for fresh breakout potential. YCA near ATH — wait for pullback. CONGRESSIONAL: Fertilizer now politically hot — DOJ antitrust + Senate Fertilizer Transparency Act. Regulatory risk caps CF/NTR upside. EU NUCLEAR POLICY: Von der Leyen called nuclear phase-out 'strategic mistake'. EC announced €200M SMR guarantee. Germany's Merz agrees. Italy repealing ban. Belgium extending fleet. This is structural, not cyclical. TONIGHT: Trump address 9PM ET (5AM UAE Apr 2). Formal withdrawal timeline expected. Watch: oil reaction, airline bounce, BTC risk-on potential, defence pullback. IAG 370p fill validates the pre-speech bounce thesis. FINAL S08 CLOSE: RCL exit bracket placed — $295 limit + $270 stop GTC (unlinked, cancel survivor). NEW VOLATILE WATCHLIST ADDED: Exail (EXA.PA) underwater robotics, Filtronic (FTC.L) SpaceX RF hardware — STANDOUT, IQE (IQE.L) compound semiconductors, Wolfspeed (WOLF) post-bankruptcy SiC, Rocket Lab (RKLB) near ATH watch only, Eutelsat (ETL.PA) satellite turnaround. Total orders: 12 active. 15 positions. Cash ready for opportunistic entries post-Trump address. SESSION 08 COMPLETE."
